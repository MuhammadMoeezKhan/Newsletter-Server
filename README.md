<strong><i> Mailchimp disables publicly shared API keys, therefore the Access keys in app.js (the server file) have been removed.</i> </strong>

Created and deployed a Node.js server to handle HTML form data requests and post data to Mailchimp databases. The server responds to whether the data was successfully sent to databases or if there were any errors. Using npm modules, I established a server, connected it to Mailchimp's API, then deployed it using Heroku's API through using CLI commands.
